        World's End is a popular tourist area located in the Horton Plains
        National Park in Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka. It consists of hill slopes
        that provide a breathtaking view of the surrounding area consisting of
        hills and meadows. The rock gets its name because it marks the end of
        the plateau and the beginning of the lowlands. From the top of the hill,
        you can see Baker's Falls, a beautiful waterfall located in the National
        Park. The World's End Trail is a popular hike that takes visitors to the
        summit where they can enjoy stunning views and fresh mountain air. The
        route is about 8 km long and takes about 4 hours to complete. It is a
        challenging climb due to the steep slope but worth it for the beautiful
        views at the end.
