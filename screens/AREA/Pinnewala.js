        Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage is a popular tourist attraction in
        Pinnawala, Sri Lanka. It is a sanctuary for orphaned and injured
        elephants. Established in 1975 by the Sri Lanka Wildlife Conservation
        Department, the orphanage has become home to over 90 elephants. It is a
        popular tourist destination as it allows visitors to closely observe and
        interact with elephants. The elephants at the orphanage are well cared
        for and given food, water and medical care. The orphanage also has a
        breeding program and many baby elephants have been born there. Visitors
        can watch elephants being fed and bathed and even bottle-fed babies.
