        Sinharaja Forest Reserve is a protected tropical rainforest in Sri
        Lanka. It is a World Heritage Site and a biodiversity hotspot, with a
        high level of endemism (meaning that many of the species found there are
        not found anywhere else in the world). The reserve is home to a wide
        variety of plant and animal species, including rare and endangered
        species such as the Sri Lankan leopard, Sri Lankan elephant, and the
        purple-faced langur. It is also an important source of timber and
        non-timber forest products for the local community. The forest is
        located in the southwest of the country and covers an area of
        approximately 11,187 hectares. It is managed by the Department of Forest
        Conservation and the Wildlife Department of the Government of Sri Lanka.
