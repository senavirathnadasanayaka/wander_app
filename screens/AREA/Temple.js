        The Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa) is a Buddhist
        temple in the city of Kandy, Sri Lanka. It is the most important
        Buddhist temple in the country and is considered a symbol of the
        Sinhalese Buddhist identity. The temple is home to a tooth relic of the
        Buddha, which is believed to have been brought to Sri Lanka from India
        in the 4th century AD. The relic is housed in a gold casket in a inner
        sanctum of the temple, which is known as the "tooth chamber." The temple
        is an important place of pilgrimage for Buddhists in Sri Lanka and
        visitors from around the world. It is also a popular tourist attraction,
        with its beautiful architecture and cultural significance. The temple is
        surrounded by a moat and is guarded by the Sri Lankan military.
